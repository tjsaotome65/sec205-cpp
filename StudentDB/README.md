StudentDB Project

This project is a demonstration of how to use:

1. Repentitive structure (while with no ending until Ctrl-C is entered)
2. FILE - sequential file access for storing/retrieving data
3. Structure - user define structure to define a student (i.e. first name, last name, course, section)
